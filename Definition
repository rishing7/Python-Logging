There are five standards logging level which allow us to what we want to log.
1. DEBUG : Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosis problems.
2. INFO : Confirmation that things are working as expected
3. WARNING : An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problems in the near future (e.g disk space low).
4. ERROR : Due to more serious problem, the software has not able to perform some function.
5. CRITICAL : A serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.


Default level for logging is set to WARNING i.e it will capture WARNING, ERROR and CRITICAL that means it going to ignore DEBUG and INFO.
E.g Lets say a program we run only we get the WARNING, ERROR and CRITICAL.

While capturing all the logs in log file must mention input and output as well.
